This: I'm Laura and I'm updating this markdown file here.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```

We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)?


Hey Laura, I made some changes to this document. Sea ya later!
