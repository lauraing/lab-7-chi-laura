This: I'm Laura and I'm updating this markdown file here.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```

We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)?

Hey Laura, I made some changes to this document. Sea ya later!

Sup Lauren! Looking gewd

Laura: data wrangling and counts

Chi-square: asks question: are proportions across groups so different that we actually think there's a sig diff between groups?

```{r}

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) # within the gender column, count how many make_get_guns show up

```
